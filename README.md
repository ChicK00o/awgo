AwGo â€” A Go library for Alfred workflows
========================================

Full-featured library to build lightning-fast workflows in a jiffy.

Features
--------

- Easy access to [Alfred context][context], such as data and cache directories.
- Straightforward generation of [Alfred JSON feedback][feedback].
- Support for all applicable Alfred features up to v3.5.
- [Fuzzy sorting/filtering][fuzzy].
- [Simple API][cache-api] for [caching/saving workflow data][cache].
- [Catches panics, logs stack trace and shows user an error message][run].
- Workflow [updates API][update] with built-in support for [GitHub releases][update-github].
- [Built-in logging][logging] for easier debugging.
- ["Magic" queries/actions][magic] for simplified development and user support.
- macOS [system icons][icons].


Documentation
-------------

Read the docs [on GoDoc][godoc].

Check out the [example workflows][examples-code] ([docs][examples-docs]), which show how to use AwGo. Use one as a template to get your own workflow up and running quickly.


Running/testing
---------------

The library, and therefore the unit tests, rely on being run in an Alfred-like environment, as they pull configuration options from environment variables (which are set by Alfred).

As such, you must `source` the `env.sh` script in the project root or run unit tests via the `run-tests.sh` script (which sources `env.sh` then calls `go test`).


Licensing & thanks
------------------

This library is released under the [MIT licence][licence].

The icon is based on the [Go Gopher][gopher] by [Renee French][renee].
